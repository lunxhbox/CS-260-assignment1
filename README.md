				Assignment 1: Design

1.	I want to have like 5 different colored marbles and then just label them with the first letter of their color. R = red, G = green, B = blue, Y = yellow and C = clear.

2.	Have the user input how many of what marbles they want to put in the bag.

3.	Also let the user decide what marbles they want to take out of the bag.

4.	Have a way for the program to tell you what marbles are still in the bag.


For variables I will use int and char to represent the bag of marbles and what color and the quantity of marbles. For methods I will prompt for the user to enter how many marbles of each color then display the amount. Then ask for how many of what marbles to be removed. Lastly display how many of each marbles remain.
